### CFoundry_SQL_Queries3
#### Summary
> This repository is meant to highlight my work in Achievement 3 of Career Foundry's Data Analytics Program. Where in this particular achievement I was tasked with posing as a data analyst who was hired by "Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department" to help with the launch strategy for their new online video service. And in order to answer the questions posed by the client (i.e. Rockbuster) I used SQL to query the data provided in said achievement.

- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
