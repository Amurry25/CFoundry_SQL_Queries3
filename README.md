### CFoundry_SQL_Queries3
#### Summary
> This repository is meant to highlight my work in Achievement 3 of Career Foundry's Data Analytics Program; where I was tasked with posing as a data analyst who was hired by "Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department" to help with the launch strategy for their new online video service. And in order to answer the questions posed by the client (i.e. Rockbuster) I used SQL to query the data provided in said achievement.

### Additional context
> The achievement also provided a series of questions said to have been asked by Rockbuster's management board that I was required to produce "data-driven" answers for based on the data sets provided; so that Rockbuster could then take said findings and incorporate them into their "2020 company strategy." 

#### Key Questions asked by Rockbuster
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
